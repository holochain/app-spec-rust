// THIS IS NOT FINAL
// There are several things missing and not worked out yet.
// Like:
//   - validate_* functions need to receive a complex struct as argument
//     that holds the entry to be validated next to the sources,
//     validation package etc.
//   - return type of these callbacks should be Result<..>, right?
//   - how to declare/write validation packages?
//   - do we need a guarding macro like zome_fns!?
//
// This file is WIP and placeholder to be overwritten by future
// PR after completing the design discussion and reaching consensus
// about these specifics.
